                    <strong>1. SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
                    <p class="mb-4">This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information submitted and collected
                        through the
                        Services. By installing, using, registering to or otherwise accessing the Services, you are

                        provide it to us. The types of personal information collected in conjunction with the activities
                        listed above will vary depending on the activity. The requested Personal Information may
                        include, but are not limited to: (i) your name, (ii) mailing address, (iii) telephone number,
                        (iv) email address, (v) photo or other image, (vi) credit card information, and (vii) location.
                        Parents or legal guardians providing parental consent (via our Parental Consent Form) may be
                        asked to provide their child’s name and email address in addition to information about

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Non-Personal Information” means information that does not
                        directly identify you. GameEon may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically
                        collect and use certain Non-Personal Information that does not directly enable GameEon to
                        identify you. The types of Non-Personal Information GameEon may collect and use include, but are
                        not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to IP address, unique device
                        identifier or other persistent or non-persistent device identifier (“Device ID”); (ii) device
                        software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip
                        code, area code and approximate location; (v) game progress, time used playing, score and
                        achievements; (vi) other Non-Personal Information as reasonably required by GameEon to enhance
                        the Services and other GameEon products and services.

                    <strong>Cookies</strong>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                        The Services may use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags, locally shared objects
                        and web beacons. GameEon treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as
                        non-personal information. A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites
                        often store on a user’s computer. Cookies do not include people’s names, email addresses, or
                        other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a
                        user’s computer and to “remember” things about the user’s visit. You can disable cookies or set
                        your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect
                        your ability to shop online and login.

                        combined together, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes,

                        The Services comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). GameEon does

                        13 within the Services or in connection with any Content or Software, GameEon will not collect,
                        store or use any personal information of such user. Further, in the event that GameEon receives
                        personal information that GameEon discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, GameEon
                        will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.

                        GameEon maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the
                        personal information we collect and store about our account holders, including children under
                        13. Personal information collected by GameEon is stored in secure operating environments that
                        are not available to the public and that are only accessible by authorized employees. In
                        addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic
                        access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number. We also have security
                        measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our
                        control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow web users to access their personal
                        information, for example, we verify their identity by requesting that they submit information
                        such as their username and password. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties
                        to whom we transfer personal information provide sufficient protection of such data.
                    </p>
